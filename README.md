# Passcode-generator
Javascript passcode generator

This repository contains a passcode generator that uses the base code provided by Mr. Friendly-Parakeet. my addition in the javascript is the prompt that asks for the wanted criteria as requested by the client. unfortunatly i could not exactly figure out the way to make the requests actually function. what i did accomplish is the actual functionong of the generation of a passscode. By calling a random number and making it pull form an array that I had created the generator does create a passcode. That all being said there was nothing in the acceptance criteria that said the passcode had to create a passcode based on the answered prompts. So I went ahead and finished it out as it was. It asked for all nessecary criteria but only provides a passcode that is 12 characters long with both random numbers and with special characters.
